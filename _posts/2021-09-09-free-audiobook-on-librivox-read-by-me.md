  Having wet my head recently in the world of audiobook narration, I’ve started
  recording another for LibriVox. But it’s not available to listen to, just yet.

Since [I wrote a post](posts/2021-07-12-librivox.md) about becoming a Librivox audiobook reader I’ve read _The Great Gatsby_ by Francis Scott Fitzgerald. It’s available to listen to now. This free audiobook on Librivox read by me, is the 2nd version of the original F. Scott Fitzgerald novel on Librivox. Nevertheless it's already had 40,469 views!  

Wikipedia says The Great Gatsby is ‘set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, near New York City. It depicts narrator Nick Carraway’s interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby’s obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan’.

On Librivox, volunteers record books in the public domain. These mp3 files are made available to listen to as free audiobooks.  

The original motion picture starred Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. I didn’t watch the recent Leonard De Caprio version. I like De Caprio but no one could improve on Redford as Gatsby, as far as I’m concerned.  

Roger Ebert of the Sun Chicago Times only gave Jack Clayton’s film 2 1/2 stars. Although he is no longer with us, Roger’s ideas and reviews usually fall in with my own world view, but sadly not that time.  

However little a few critics appeared to have enjoyed the 1974 film, it opened my eyes to F. Scott Fitzgerald’s wonderful storytelling in this modern classic.  

[Click this link](https://archive.org/details/greatgatsby_2109_librivox) and listen to a chapter or two of my audiobook version of _The Great Gatsby_. 

I hope you enjoy listening.
