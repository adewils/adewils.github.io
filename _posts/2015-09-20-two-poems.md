I wrote a couple of small (and imperfectly formed) poems&#8230;The first was my take on an &#8216;echo&#8217; poem* where the prompt was &#8216;edge&#8217;. Typically oblique, I made U2&#8217;s guitarist, the Edge, (aka David Howell <a href="http://www.atu2.com/band/edge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evans</a>) the subject&#8230;

**Who am I?**

<p class="has-text-align-left">
  When you are with friends, what are you called?<br /><em>Bald!</em><br />You were born on which day?<br /><em>Sunday</em><br />On whose guitars magical chords do you etch?<br /><em>Gretsch</em><br />An item of clothing reflecting your personae?<br /><em>Bandana</em><br />You travel the world in boats, trains&#8230; and?<br /><em>Planes?</em><br />When you are on stage, what name do they allege?<br /><em>Edge</em>

On [Anne You Huang&#8217;s poetry blog](https://www.annhuang.com/blog/2016/05/20/5-techniques-used-by-surrealist-poets/) I found an excellent (and far more proficient) example of an echo poem &#8230;

My second poem is a [diamante](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamante_poem) where the prompts were a starting point of &#8216;young&#8217; and an ending of &#8216;old&#8217;. The idea was a smooth transition from one to another. See how I did&#8230;

**Age**

Young  
Elastic, callow  
Springing, laughing, everlasting  
New every day, Seen it all  
Bending, stumbling, aching  
Jaded, painful  
Old
