Having wet my head recently in the world of audiobook narration, I’ve started recording another for LibriVox. But it’s not available to listen to just yet!  

My new book may not be quite as glamorous as The Great Gatsby, which by the way has now had nearly 41,000 page views, but this author has been very much in the public eye, thanks to the acting of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman In the Sherlock Holmes stories on BBC television.  

The audiobook I’m reading is the _Memories and Adventures of Sir Arthur Doyle_.  
  
_The Great Gatsby_ only had nine chapters. My latest audiobook has 32 (yes, thirty-two!) I’ve already recorded 27, so I only have 5 chapters left to read, before this new audiobook can be released for free download.
