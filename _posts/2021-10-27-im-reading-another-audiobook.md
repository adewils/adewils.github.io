Having wet my head recently in the world of audiobook narration, I’ve started recording another for LibriVox. But it’s not available to listen to, just yet.  

My new book may not be quite as glamorous as _The Great Gatsby_, which by the way has now had nearly 41,000 page views, but this author has been very much in the public eye, thanks to the acting of Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman In the Sherlock Holmes stories on BBC television.  
I’m reading the _Memories and Adventures by Sir Arthur Doyle_ as an audiobook now. It's quite a lot of work. After all _The Great Gatsby_ only had 9 chapters but my latest audiobook has 32 (yes, thirty-two). I’ve already recorded 28, so I only have 4 chapters left to read before this new audiobook can be released for free download.
