<p class="has-drop-cap">
  Taking photos is graciously allowed inside Malagá&#8217;s Centro de Arte Contemperanéo (known as the CAC) . It is probably the norm at most galleries these days. I’ve taken advantage in Glasgow, Liverpool, London and in Malaga.
</p>

And so inside the CAC I photographed my favourite parts of the “Portraits of Garbage” installations which Muniz created at&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardim_Gramacho" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jardim Granacho</a>, a Rio garbage landfill site. 

People lived on Jardim Granacho, eking out a living picking through the garbage for ‘valuable’ items to sell, instructed by gang masters, until the site closed down in 2012 after 34 years of operation.

Muniz made a film about the project, which he named &#8220;Wasteland&#8221;, and it’s available as a DVD from Amazon.

When I got back home, I was so impressed by the work I’d seen in the photos, I wanted to write about it. Some lines of poetry came to me and I set it down in verse&#8230; non-rhyming of course! You can hear a reading of the poem, which I named “For Your Pleasure”, in the video below. Or you can read the poem yourself <a href="https://www.adewils.com/latest/video-of-muniz-portraits-of-garbage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.

The title &#8220;For Your Pleasure&#8221; was a nod to the art house band Roxy Music, whose album of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_Your_Pleasure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the same name</a> over the years, has given me much enjoyment . 

The music on the video is “Granaina” by Pepe Habuelcha from the album, “The Beginner’s Guide to Flamenco”.
