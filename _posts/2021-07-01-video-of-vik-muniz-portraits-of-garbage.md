  It’s hard to believe it was 2012 when I saw Vik Muniz' Portraits of Garbage
  exhibition at the CAC Malaga. I made a video!

  Taking photos is graciously allowed inside Malagá’s Centro de Arte Contemperanéo (known as the CAC) . It is probably the norm at most galleries these days. I’ve taken advantage in Glasgow, Liverpool, London and in Malaga.  
  
And so inside the CAC I photographed my favourite parts of the “Portraits of Garbage” installations which Muniz created at Jardim Granacho, a Rio garbage landfill site. 
People lived on Jardim Granacho, eking out a living picking through the garbage for ‘valuable’ items to sell, instructed by gang masters, until the site closed down in 2012 after 34 years of operation.  

Muniz made a film about the project, which he named “Wasteland”, and it’s available as a DVD from Amazon.  

When I got back home, I was so impressed by the work I’d seen in the photos, I wanted to write about it. Some lines of poetry came to me and I set it down in verse… non-rhyming of course! You can hear a reading of the poem, which I named “For Your Pleasure”, in the video below. Or you can read the poem yourself here.  

The title “For Your Pleasure” was a nod to the art house band Roxy Music, whose album of the same name over the years, has given me much enjoyment.  

The music on the video is “Granaina” by Pepe Habuelcha from the album, “The Beginner’s Guide to Flamenco”.
