It was a hot day and I wanted to be outside relaxing in the fresh air, but I’ve always got to be doing something! I think that’s how many of us are nowadays. Sometimes you have to force yourself to do nothing at all. That’s probably where Mindfulness comes in handy. I didn’t succeed in doing nothing on this hot day. I got my pencil and paper out instead. I thought a self portrait might be something I could manage, but didn’t have a mirror I could stand on the table. So I got my iPad out and turned the camera around to selfie mode. The screen wasn’t easy to see because the light outside was so bright... er, well that’s my excuse anyway
