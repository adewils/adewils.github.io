I passed a window full of mannequins.

Yeah&#8230; OK, shop dummies. And they looked gorgeous, so pink and blonde and so pure. I envied them their life. No air, no time, no work, no stress, no food&#8230; No worries.

My fingers stuck to the glass. Chin up against it. I saw myself in a mirror. They&#8217;d put mirrors up to make the room look bigger. And I could see the ends of my fingers stuck to the glass in the lights. They was white. And I let the tension go out my wrists, and my hands and my finger ends became pink, yeah? and as they unstuck, they were brown again. And I looked at my brown face in the mirror, and I looked at theirs again and y&#8217;know I hated them. &#8216;cos they&#8217;re not real. None of it. It&#8217;s not real is it?

Y&#8217;know what? there&#8217;s this bin outside by one of those phone box things. No, not a phone box like you talk in. One where all the wires go, you know? I picked it up. No, the bin. I dunno how I did it. It was full of proper stinkin&#8217; stuff. I was nearly sick with it. Don&#8217;t they empty them now? I just got my hands in the openings y&#8217;know and I just moved back near the road and I just launched it.

It was so funny! One minute it was such a perfect scene in there. Y&#8217;know like housie-housie.

Yeah yeah, I meant nicey-nicey. Yeah you was right. All right, yeah&#8230; _again._

Then when this bin went through the glass it was like Hiro&#8230; wotsit? Yeah.. yeah Hiroshima or something&#8217;. The dummies went flying&#8217; all over &#8216;n&#8217; this alarm starts flashin&#8217;. Pretty weak glass in&#8217;it? I thought it was supposed to be wotsit, toughened now? Well that Selfridges stuff, it&#8217;s like plastic or cellophane! Smashed right through it.

And y&#8217;know what? I couldn&#8217;t hear that freakin&#8217; alarm. Know why? Every other freakin shop had smashed windows and alarms goin&#8217; off. Ha ha ha! Yeah that&#8217;s why i chose that one. It hadn&#8217;t been done. They missed that one.

Man, it&#8217;s weird though innit? I turned into Onslow Road and the whole freakin&#8217; street was on fire. Nah, not the houses&#8230; Like wotsit, yeah the tarmac? Musta been petrol or oil on the road. And man it was roasting&#8217; there! I mean all the cars y&#8217;know, they were just on one side of the road. Yeah no parkin&#8217; on the other. And they was all on fire too. Man, it was a firestorm. I only looked. I didn&#8217;t go down there. Couldn&#8217;t hack it, man. It was wild. Yeah, love it!
