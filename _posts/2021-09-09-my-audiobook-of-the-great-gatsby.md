Since I wrote <a href="https://www.adewils.com/latest/librivox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this post about becoming a Librivox audiobook reader</a> I&#8217;ve read _The Great Gatsby_ by Francis Scott Fitzgerald. It&#8217;s available to listen to now. This free audiobook on Librivox read by me, is the 2nd version of the original F. Scott Fitzgerald novel on Librivox. Nevertheless it &#8216;s already had 37,000 views!

Wikipedia says _The Great Gatsby is &#8216;_set in the&nbsp;Jazz Age&nbsp;on&nbsp;Long Island, near New York City. It depicts&nbsp;narrator&nbsp;Nick Carraway&#8217;s interactions with mysterious millionaire&nbsp;Jay Gatsby and Gatsby&#8217;s obsession to reunite with his former lover,&nbsp;Daisy Buchanan&#8217;.

On Librivox, volunteers record books in the&nbsp;[public domain](http://wiki.librivox.org/index.php/Copyright_and_Public_Domain). These mp3 files&nbsp;are made available to listen to as free audiobooks.

The original motion picture starred Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. I didn&#8217;t watch the recent Leonard De Caprio version. I like De Caprio but no one could improve on Redford as Gatsby, as far as I&#8217;m concerned.

Roger Ebert of the Sun Chicago Times only gave Jack Clayton&#8217;s film 2 1/2 stars. Roger&#8217;s ideas and reviews generally fall in with my own world view, but sadly not that time. 

However little a few critics appeared to have enjoyed the 1974 film, it opened my eyes to F. Scott Fitzgerald&#8217;s wonderful storytelling in this modern classic. 

Click this link <a href="https://archive.org/details/greatgatsby_2109_librivox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://archive.org/details/greatgatsby_2109_librivox</a> and listen to a chapter or two of my audiobook version of _The Great Gatsby_. There are also various download options. I hope you enjoy listening.
