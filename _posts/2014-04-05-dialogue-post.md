</p>

<p>
  “And here I am”
</p>

<p>
  “Aye well &#8230;’appen.  Anything new?”
</p>

<p>
  “Anything new?  You’ve never said that to me before.  It’s usually “‘owt new” is what you say!&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  “It’s just a manner of speakin’ Joyce.”
</p>

<p>
  “Well you’ve changed.  Gone posh I think.”
</p>

<p>
  “What, me?”
</p>

<p>
  “Never used to speak to me like that before.  Least not in that way.”
</p>

<p>
  “Before?  Before what?”
</p>

<p>
  “Well, you know&#8230;. Before.”
</p>

<p>
  “Aye well, that’s how things are now.  There’s now and well&#8230; there’s before.  And things are different now.”
</p>

<p>
  “I know Bob.  I know they are.  I’m missing you Bob.  I’m missing you an awful lot love.”
</p>

<p>
  “Well we’ve got to be strong about it old girl.  It’s just the way things turned out.  Don’t go soft on me now.”
</p>

<p>
  “You’ll be telling me next that it’s not for ever and stuff like that.”
</p>

<p>
  “Aye well.  Maybe I will and maybe I won’t”
</p>

<p>
  “Any news, Bob?”
</p>

<p>
  “You can still make me laugh though Joyce”
</p>

<p>
  “Can I?”
</p>

<p>
  “Aye it’s just the way you say things, You were copyin’ me, weren’t you eh?”
</p>

<p>
  “Well&#8230;  maybe I was and maybe I wa’n’t.  S-o-o-o-o??”
</p>

<p>
  “I do know what you mean old girl.  I don’t ferget that quickly.”
</p>

<p>
  “Bob you always were sharp.  You’ve a slow way of talking, but your mind’s always been like a razor.”
</p>

<p>
  “Mr Welbeck’s been in to see me.  Proper respectful like.  He fussed around ‘e did.  It would’ve been proper funny if it hadn’t been &#8230; well, strange. Joyce”
</p>

<p>
  “I know Bob.  I know it must be proper strange for you, ‘cos it’s funny for me too.”
</p>

<p>
  “Funny?  Funny old girl.  Nowt funny about it from here”
</p>

<p>
  “I know Bob.  Anyway&#8230;. Mr Welbeck’s always been good to this family.  He’s done you proud though Bob.  You look beautiful.  I’ve never seen you looking so clean and well&#8230; well&#8230; you know, well turned out.”
</p>

<p>
  “He’s a smart as they come is Mr Welbeck”
</p>

<p>
  “No you Bob.  You’re the smart ‘un in your new suit.”
</p>

<p>
  “Does it look good Joyce?  I wanted to look me best for you.  Well you &#8230; and the boys.  They couldn’t come Joyce?  Not tonight?”
</p>

<p>
  “Not tonight Bob.  Not tonight.  To tell you the truth Bob, well Robert was a bit upset.  And Jamie, well James went out with Margie.  They do look good together Bob.”
</p>

<p>
  “I know they do lass, but I just thought that tonight&#8230;. well you mightn’t have to come out on your own”
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
  “Himposition!  Himposition!  I should think not it’s no Himposition to come out te see your husband Joyce”

</p>

<p>
  “e Bob, but you do look good.  Best I’ve seen you for an awful long time.  This is really doing you good, love.”
</p>

<p>
  “I’m feeling a bit worn out now though Joyce.  Are you coming again tomorrow?  I’ve not been used to talkin’ this much for a while, and if it’s all the same to you, I think I need a bit more quiet now.”
</p>

<p>
  “I understand Bob.  I think you must get used to the peace and quiet.  He is a benevolent God isn’t he, Bob?”
</p>

<p>
  “Aye he’s everything they cracked ‘im up to be luv.  Proper champion.  Quite the gent.  I’m proper proud to have met &#8216;im.  A lot happier than I thought I would be actually, well, you know&#8230; to be dead.  I’ll see you tomorrow Joyce.”
</p>

<p>
  “See you tomorrow, Bob.  Don’t you worry. We’ll all be there.  Night night love.”
