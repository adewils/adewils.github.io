<p style="text-align: center;">
  Haiku is a Japanese form of short poetry. A traditional haiku consist of 17 syllables, in three phrases of 5, 7 and 5 syllables respectively. Here&#8217;s one I wrote in 2010. Short, but sweet?<!--more-->
  
  <br /> <em>First, pitch dark ahead</em><br /> <em>Strike xenon gas into life</em><br /> <em>The road eggs me on</em>
</p>
