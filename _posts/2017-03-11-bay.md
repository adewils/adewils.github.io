Well the drawing lessons have been running for a few weeks now but I&#8217;ve been unhappy with my output from them. Maybe it was time to get out from the classroom into the great outdoors and draw what I wanted instead.&nbsp;It was dull and a bit damp when I arrived at the bench I&#8217;d selected to sit on. Thankfully it wasn&#8217;t damp enough enough to wet the paper, while&nbsp;I spent the best part of 2 hours sketching.&nbsp; Funny how stiff you get just drawing! &nbsp;Good job it&#8217;s not an Olympic sport.

For the uninitiated&nbsp;I&#8217;m holding my sketch in front of the subject, which is the bay near my home.<figure class="wp-block-image size-large">
