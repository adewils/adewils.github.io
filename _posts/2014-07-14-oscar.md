<span><span><a href="https://www.adewils.com/">Home</a></span><br />This poem is about one of my cats&#8230; <!--more-->

<br /> </p> 

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Another green world opens, pink-lidded.<br /> A golden orb<br /> Cast its sheen on me<br /> Ready<br /> Ready to take on<br /> What the world has to offer<br /> Any bird, any mouse, any damn&#8217; thing<br /> Make my day<br /> &#8230;punk.
  </p>
