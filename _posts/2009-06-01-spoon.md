excerpt: "Here's a 'concrete poem' I wrote. Concrete, pattern, or shape poetry is … “poetry in which the typographical arrangement of words is as important in conveying the intended effect as the conventional elements of the poem, such as meaning of words, rhythm, rhyme, and so on.  Judge for yourself if I managed it!"

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Wikipedia describes concrete, pattern, or shape poetry as &#8230; &#8220;poetry in which the typographical arrangement of words is as important in conveying the intended effect as the conventional elements of the poem, such as meaning of words, rhythm, rhyme, and so on.  It is sometimes referred to as visual poetry, a term that has come to have distinct meaning of its own, but which shares the distinction of being poetry in which the visual elements are as important as the text.&#8221;

  <strong>Spoon</strong>
</h1>

<p align="center">
  When I dig down
</p>

<p align="center">
  deep, deep into the honey
</p>

<p align="center">
  pot with my familiar silver spoon this
</p>

<p align="center">
  golden apian life sucks me under, and I am gilded
</p>

<p align="center">
  once more, in an amber arc, above perfect, pale
</p>

<p align="center">
  waxen cells, mid shafts of mhyrric light, my wings swing
</p>

<p align="center">
  back and forth in a mesmerising slow beat ,while below
</p>

<p align="center">
  beneath the curve of my bronzy back, a queen passes
</p>

<p align="center">
  the hours in high regal splendour as I fan her gently
</p>

<p align="center">
  in the treacly summer heat, and tempt her with
</p>

<p align="center">
  royal  jelly, thick as molasses, cool dew
</p>

<p align="center">
  to drink mined at dawn from a million
</p>

<p align="center">
  vivid blooms, until she swells
</p>

<p align="center">
  swarming with massive
</p>

<p align="center">
  fecund strength
</p>

<p align="center">
  and beats
</p>

<p align="center">
  down walls
</p>

<p align="center">
  to join me
</p>

<p align="center">
  high on
</p>

<p align="center">
  pulsing
</p>

<p align="center">
  waggle
</p>

<p align="center">
  dancing
</p>

<p align="center">
  air
</p>
