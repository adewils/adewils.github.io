<p>
  The rain was falling in rivulets down the windows by the time the car pulled up outside the police station.<br /> Redundantly Jacobs intoned &#8220;We have arrived madam&#8221;.
</p>

<p>
  The family&#8217;s faithful retainer opened and held the car door for me. The rain was pouring off the peak of his black chauffeur&#8217;s hat. The drab pavements were flooding like a levee had broken.
</p>

<p>
  I gathered my mackintosh around me and pulled its hood down while Jacobs unfurled a large black umbrella and raised it over our bowed heads. I heard the doors locking as we made an unsteady journey to the opened door of the precinct building.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;Miss Lois, please come in,&#8221; said Inspector Henderson. His grizzled hair was wholly in keeping with the tone of the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
  I felt myself shake my arms and coat Like an Alsatian freshly in from the lake.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;Very bad weather we&#8217;re having in Metropolis today, Miss Lois.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;Please, just Lois.&#8221; I said.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;Yes, Miss Lois&#8221; he said in his soft Irish brogue &#8220;Here, let me take your coat.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  I unwrapped myself from the soaking raincoat, and drew some fingers through my hair, by way of making myself feel more presentable. But he didn&#8217;t care. We were only here for one reason.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;This is Mr Harper&#8221; he inclined a nod towards a short dumpy little man with a few remaining strands of hair glistening on his head. The little man had sharp blue eyes similar to those of a mynah bird we once had caged in the kitchen at home. Gordon continued, &#8220;He&#8217;s my most trusted forensic man. He&#8217;ll take you through to the morgue and help you with the identification. I should warn you that it will harrowing for you Miss Lois.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  I swallowed heavily and felt heat waves running through my scalp &#8220;I&#8217;m prepared&#8221; I lied through my clenched teeth.<br /> A sharp astringent smell irritated my nostrils when Harper opened the door of the morgue. I coughed slightly and felt for a tissue in the pocket of my skirt.
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;I&#8217;m going to lift this sheet, and all you have to do is nod if you recognise the face. Do you understand Miss Lois?&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  &#8220;I do.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
  He lifted the sheet and I saw Clark&#8217;s closed eyes in his waxy lifeless face&#8230;
</p>
