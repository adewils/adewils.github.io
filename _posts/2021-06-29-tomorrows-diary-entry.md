“Ow! Bastard!!” Someone’s poking me in the eyes with needles. I can’t make them stop. 

As I almost become accustomed to the agony under my eyelids, I’m grateful for the numbness that starts to set in. I turn away from the bright light. That might help. A sound in the room.  

“Why the hell did you do that?” I manage to mutter.

“We open the curtains every morning. What’s so different about today?”  

“I feel terrible.”  

“Must be those cocktails you had last night.”

“I don’t drink cocktails.” I slur. “I drink beer. Man’s drink.. Why?”  

“Why what?”  

“Cocktails…” Even the thought revolts me.

“Which one?” I’ve several teams I support, based on their performances.  

“England”, the Scotswoman wielding the curtains blurts out.
