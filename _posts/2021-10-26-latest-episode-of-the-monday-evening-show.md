The Late Show’s dead! Well… dead to me, anyhow! The schedule on www.baytrustradio.org.uk has had an Autumn refresh, which means a change of day for me.    

 After 99 episodes of the Late Show on Sunday nights, I’m now presenting the latest episode of Bay Trust Radio’s alternative music show on Monday evening.  
 
 [Here’s a podcast](https://www.mixcloud.com/BayTrustRadio/monday-evening-with-adrian-wilson-8) of the latest episode 107 in which I showcased the 35 artists I’d played the most over the last year (October 2020 to October 2021). If you listen to the show regularly you might be able to guess a few of them!  
 
 Join me every week, Monday’s at 7pm (GMT)  
 
 Before the pandemic I recorded my radio shows in a dedicated studio at the local hospital. However when COVID-19 hit, the studio became an office. Since then Bay Trust Radio (based in Kendal, Cumbria, UK) has been waiting for the hospital to release an area to become the new studio.  
 
 I’m still making my shows at home connecting over the internet to the main studio at Windermere General Hospital.  
 
 You can listen 24 x 7 on your phone, tablet, your computer or on a smart speaker.
