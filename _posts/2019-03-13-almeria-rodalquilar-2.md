  In <a href="https://www.adewils.com/travel-writing/barcelona-almeria/">Part 7</a> we travelled from Barcelona to Almería city. Now read on&#8230;
</p>

### Taxi ride

Our Airbnb hostess negotiated a taxi trip from Almeria city to the _pueblo blanco_ (white village) of Rodalquilar for €50. The price seemed a bit steep but being so close to what would be our resting place for a couple of weeks, we&#8217;d probably have paid almost anything to finally get there. We threw our luggage in the boot (aka trunk) and jumped in the car, waving goodbye to Almeria for now.

### Almeria city

Almeria is a very nice city, with a long beach-front, but off the normal tourist track. A year before we’d stayed for a week in a tiny apartment on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" label="Calle Rueda Lopez (opens in a new tab)" href="https://goo.gl/maps/kgLQDU8RxP24YeCE8" target="_blank">Calle Rueda Lopez</a>. Rueda Lopez is just off the very long Avenida Frederico Garcia Lorca, which runs down to the sea. There&#8217;s a lovely narrow palm-lined park containing fountains, running gently alongside the busy Frederico Garcia Lorca for about a mile down to the port. It provides some escape from the busy traffic and its&#8217; fumes. (Later after spending time in the fresh air of Cabo de Gata national park, I especially noticed the fumes when I needed to take a trip into town for some shopping.)

### El&nbsp;**Cable Inglés**

Francisco Garcia Lorca ends just below the soaring oxidised metal of El Cable Ingles (also known as El Alquife). Until 1973 a railway transported minerals 90km by train from some French and British-run mines. The line ended at El Cable Ingles in the port of Almeria where the ships waited to take cargo to northern Spain and abroad. Those days are gone now.

### Sea of plastic

Enormous seas of unattractive plastic greenhouses in a wilderness landscape were the initial views from the taxi, once we were out of Almeria city. Eventually these eyesores, valuable as they are to Spain&#8217;s economy, disappeared from view as we travelled into the park.

### Arrival

Our small dog Piper, unconcerned as ever, napped between us in his pet carrier on the taxi&#8217;s rear seat, until the village of Rodalquilar hove into view in a white blur in the midday sun and we arrived thankfully outside our Airbnb destination.
