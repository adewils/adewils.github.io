### Pet friendly?

In my last post <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.adewils.com/travel-writing/fly/" target="_blank">The fly in the ointment</a> I told you that in the middle of planning to escape the UK winter I&#8217;d rather stupidly bought a long-haired Chihuahua. I&#8217;d also decided I wasn&#8217;t able to drive a vehicle as far as Spain, so would travel by rail with my pet to achieve sweet freedom from the UK winter&#8230; Urgent re-planning required! 

### Pet passports

If you&#8217;re planning to take a pet abroad you need to pay a visit to your vet. Firstly, your dog or cat must be <a href="https://www.gov.uk/get-your-dog-microchipped" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chipped</a>. Believe it or not, he or she also needs a rabies injection and its own <a href="https://www.gov.uk/take-pet-abroad" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">passport</a>. Don&#8217;t worry, the rabies injection didn&#8217;t affect my dog in any way, apart from making him rabies proof of course! The injection and passport cost me a total of around £120.

### Seat 61

To take a pet abroad from the United Kingdom into Europe, without a vehicle &#8211; in other words as a foot passenger &#8211; you can only travel on the <a href="https://www.dfdsseaways.co.uk/ferry-routes/ferry-to-france/newhaven-dieppe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newhaven &#8211; Dieppe ferry</a>&nbsp; You return after your holiday on the Dieppe &#8211; Newhaven ferry. I learnt this using the very useful <a href="https://www.seat61.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seat 61</a>&nbsp;website for train travellers. It has a section for those of us who can&#8217;t bear to leave the little critters behind when we go off having fun in the sun. This great site gives the low-down on travelling to all parts of Europe, even to Russia. Handy even for folks travelling to the World Cup in 2018 perhaps.

And if you aren&#8217;t a pet owner, you&#8217;ll be pleased to know the site gives great info for people train travelling, without pets too.

### Newhaven port

<a href="https://www.newhaventowncouncil.gov.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newhaven</a>&nbsp;is in Sussex, so first of all you need to get there from wherever you live. For us that involved, believe it or not, 5 train trips! I hope for your sake you live nearer the capital.

### Airbnb

We needed to stay overnight in Newhaven because we live so far from London. Here my old friend <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://airbnb.com" target="_blank">Airbnb</a>&nbsp;came in useful. Airbnb if you didn&#8217;t know allows people to rent out an entire place (a house or an apartment) or just rent out a room in their house. Newhaven is a popular destination for travellers because of the ferry. Accommodation can be £90+ and difficult to find. My advice is to book early to avoid disappointment. I booked a room a few miles from the ferry terminal, before I left home.

In my experience the places you come across, after you&#8217;ve booked and arrived, don&#8217;t always live up to your expectations. But you have to take the rough with the smooth when you&#8217;re travelling. We took the rough, this time. But less of that! We took the bus to the Airbnb place from Newhaven railway station &#8211; that&#8217;s 6 journeys to get here!

If you&#8217;re lucky enough to be taking a pet abroad, sadly he or she can&#8217;t travel with you on the ship. Pets must be slapped in chains in the hold. Well almost! &nbsp;That doesn&#8217;t seem very pet friendly, does it?

And [next time](https://www.adewils.com/travel/channel-crossing/) I&#8217;ll tell you more about all of that &#8230;
