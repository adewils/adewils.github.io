Steve got a writing toolkit for Christmas, so we each took one of its&#8217; emery boards containing a prompt, and started writing. He interrupted us every 5 minutes with another line which we used to change the direction of our stories. 

My starting prompt was: _I loved the way she said &#8220;balloon&#8221;. She said it as if she were blowing bubbles_&#8230; 

Further Interruptions are in italics below.

## Interruptions

_I loved the way she said &#8220;balloon&#8221;. She said it as if she were blowing bubbles_&#8230; 

I took the long purple tube from Joan Rivers, put it to my lips and blew. A terrible bang rang out and I was left with puce rubber all over my face.

&#8220;Brilliant…&#8221; she said, &#8220;You&#8217;ve come as the Hunchback of Notre Dame.&#8221;

&#8220;Joan, you never fail to deliver.&#8221; I was forced to laugh in spite of my annoyance.

_Just then, a supermodel with a large cat, walked into the room._

&#8220;Rod doesn&#8217;t like purple&#8221; Kate Moss said, stroking her pussy.  
  
&#8220;Okay, Zelda give me a gold one. Give me the R balloon&#8221; I said, motioning at them on the table.

&#8220;He loves only gold&#8221; said Kate. This was like getting ready to meet royalty, I thought.

&#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to like him. Just as long as he doesn&#8217;t wear plaid,&#8221; I said, picking up on Kate&#8217;s film theme, in between lungfuls of air and blows into the large gold sphere, which was slowly growing between my finger and thumb.

&#8220;Why?&#8221; said Zelda.

&#8220;Dead Men Don&#8217;t Wear Plaid!&#8221; I said triumphantly. But she didn&#8217;t get it. Obviously never heard of the film. Zelda looked blank while Kate added to my general feeling of hysteria by countering with &#8220;That was Steve Martin, and not Rod Stewart besides…&#8221; She broke off.

&#8220;What was that? I saw something out of the window. Look up there. _It&#8217;s a bat circling in the sky!_&#8220;

&#8220;Fruit bats are good eating, I hear&#8221; said Zelda.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous!&#8221; I laughed giving up on the balloon blowing. &#8220;Who&#8217;s going to eat a bat. What kind of horrible disease could you catch from one of those rodents. Rabies?&#8221;

&#8220;Well my cat loves them.&#8221;

&#8220;That&#8217;s enough for me, Ms Moss. Let me catch one for her!&#8221;

&#8220;What are you going to do? Invite it in, to blow up a balloon?&#8221;

&#8220;No they have very tiny lips, couldn&#8217;t possibly manage it&#8221; I said as I looked around the room. There was nothing I could possibly use to catch the bat… Except _a crooked umbrella!_! I picked the brolly up and ran out to the verandah with it. Kate and Zelda were right behind me.

&#8220;Is that a Bentley?&#8221; said Kate.

I put my left arm up to sight the soaring creature drew my right arm back and launched the umbrella spiralling up ever upward into the wonderful sunset.

&#8220;It is, it&#8217;s Mr Rod Stewart!&#8221;

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw a mop top in a tartan suit, stepping out of the rear door of a classic car.

Then horrified, I looked down again, gasping as Stewart clutched at his belly, where the falling umbrella had pierced him through. A scarlet stain spread slowly on the drive around him, as his minders clustered helplessly around.

Kate and Zelda were screaming next to me on the balcony. Time for a sharp exit.\[/vc\_column\_text\]\[/vc\_column\][/vc\_row]
