_I wrote this piece of flash fiction after I&#8217;d been given &#8216;a prompt&#8217;. A writing prompt&#8217;s a word or phrase &nbsp;intended to stimulate a story or a poem. The prompt I was given was the phrase &#8216;Gardenias again&#8217;. I&#8217;ve always loved [noir fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noir_fiction) and this scenario below came into my mind from somewhere out in the ether_ &#8230;

It was past my usual finish time, when I wearily climbed the stairs to my apartment. The Soames woman stepped out of her door, catching me in the hall.

&#8220;Did you come home for lunch today, Mr Harris? &nbsp;I heard you singing along to the radio. Quite a nice voice,&nbsp;dearie.&#8221; She dropped a plastic charity sack to leave for collection sometime maybe.

I thought about&nbsp;the windows I once broke caterwauling at&nbsp;the Glee Club, and said &#8220;No time for lunch today.&nbsp; We were closing a big deal and the owner asked us to work through. Said he&#8217;d see us all right at the end of the month though.&#8221;

Mrs Soames&nbsp;frowned, and shook&nbsp;her head at my masochistic attitude to nutrition, &nbsp;retreating back to her apartment, like a gnarled turtle to its shell.

Someone&#8217;d stamped out a&nbsp;half-smoked Black Sobranie outside&nbsp;my door. &nbsp;&#8220;Damn’ postmen &#8230;&nbsp;paid too much these days.&#8221; &nbsp;I grumbled. &#8220;That and their elastic bands everywhere. Goddamn Sumatra&#8217;s gone broke &#8216;cos of them.&#8221; 

I was really enjoying being a crusty old guy these days.

Opening the front door I realised, must have&nbsp;left the hall light on before walking out&nbsp;this morning. &nbsp;I hung my coat on the hall stand, dropped my case and headed for the drinks trolley, like a fish looking&nbsp;for water.

“My usual, bartender.”

Funny thing&#8230;&nbsp;not like me to leave a drink&nbsp;unfinished, but there was a glass with a half inch of bourbon still hanging around on the trolley. Could I afford to ditch even a half inch of old bourbon? Didn&#8217;t smell the same when it was left out all day but whatever way you drank it, it was still bourbon. Down the hatch.

After filling a new one&nbsp;with a couple more fingers of the good stuff, I left&nbsp;the old glass in the kitchen for the maid to sort out.

Yeah&nbsp;that’s right&#8230; me, the next time I wash up.

I pride myself on my nose. (I know, it&#8217;s big enough &#8211; there, I thought I&#8217;d say it before you did), but&nbsp;in spite of having started in on the&nbsp;Woodford Reserve, a pretty fragrant brew in itself, I was sure I could maybe smell gardenias.

&#8220;Reminds me of&nbsp;the perfume Jane used to wear&#8221;. It had crossed my cerebral cortex before I had a chance to stop it.

I hadn&#8217;t opened any of the windows yet, not even the French ones.&nbsp;So it couldn&#8217;t be the smell of flowers drifting in. Then, just as quickly, it&nbsp;was gone, like cigarette smoke in&nbsp;an&nbsp;afternoon breeze. I hunted high and low with my famed nose, but no gardenias anymore. I reasoned it was better to have loved &#8217;em and lost &#8217;em than never to have smelled &#8217;em. I&#8217;m like that. Pragmatic, all the way down the line.

After a TV dinner and a half bottle of good ole Mister Montepulciano, I went to turn in. &nbsp;I dunno&#8230; all work, and no play these days.

Would you believe the maid hadn&#8217;t put my spare toothbrush back in the bathroom cabinet after that last work trip to St Louis? There it was on the washstand, like I&#8217;d used it this morning. But I hadn&#8217;t. Weird stuff happening round here.

Can&#8217;t understand this&nbsp;drop&nbsp;in my usual household standards. &nbsp;I&#8217;m usually quite a &#8216;together&#8217;&nbsp;guy.

Folks&#8217;ll be&nbsp;phoning the Good Housekeeping Institute if I don’t clean up my act.
