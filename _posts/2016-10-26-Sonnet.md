If this sonnet is one of the worst you've ever read I apologise.  I think the premise is fine, but the execution is poor. When I wrote this in 2009 I was pleased with it but I now look back on it with the fondness of a father regarding his child, who is learning to walk.  This particular child never did learn to walk.  Poetry will never be my strong suit, but surely it's the taking part that matters.  

The poem was inspired by watching TV adverts showing shiny, happy people buying nice sofas, immediately followed by 'Warzone', a Channel 5 documentary series following the lives of British servicemen and women at Kandahar Airbase, Afghanistan. Amongst the team was a fire crew, who had put out a plane fire.  The juxtaposition of life in the UK and in Afghanistan was the catalyst for me. This was one of the first things I wrote in my first Creative Writing evening class. 

### Sonnet

How can it be that I can snuggle down  
And be cauterised, then anaesthetised  
By two minute idiotic, sales pitches  
And situations turning comi to tragi  
All this only a matinee to the Main Event  
The Pay-Per-View war on Reality TV. 
On the 47 inch plasma screen the sand  
Burns in brown and yellow orange then red  
In dayglo bibs, Essex boys douse the flames  
“Hell, that Harrier’ll never jump again!”  
Inside, the bleached blond skeleton of the boy  
Whose skin, desert winds will no more caress  
He’ll never push away the joystick  
In Afghan skies and fly home, over Iran
