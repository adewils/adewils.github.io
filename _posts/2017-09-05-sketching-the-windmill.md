#### Hey it&#8217;s Springtime! 

<p class="has-drop-cap">
  A lovely day brought out lots of visitors to the town. I felt I should go draw. The windmill shouldn&#8217;t be too challenging to sketch, I thought! You can see how wrong I was.
</p>

I hid in a shelter with people eating fish and chips on the other side of it and I drew what I thought I saw. It&#8217;s a classic mistake to draw what you don&#8217;t see, to imagine what&#8217;s there &#8211; or so I hear&#8230; 

I&#8217;ve photographed the sketch and some of the scene.

Oh well. Onward and upward.
