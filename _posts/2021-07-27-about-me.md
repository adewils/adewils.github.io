  <em>About night school, writers groups, writing stories, poems, this blog. About me.</em>
</p>

Readin&#8217; and writin&#8217; have always been easier for me than &#8216;rithmetic, so that&#8217;s why this isn&#8217;t a blog about numbers. Mathematicians see beauty in equations, but I never could understand them. 

I always enjoyed reading a story more than solving Pythagoras, a subject of which I know as little about as could fit on a pinhead. As a child I read voraciously. Then, as probably now, the teacher often wanted kids to write a story in class. It passed the time, expanded our imaginations and gave the teacher valuable time to plan and mark work.

## Night school

In my 30s I decided to go to night school and do a creative writing course. I really, really enjoyed it. I could excel at the same time as enjoying the other student&#8217;s contributions and learn from them. Occasionally I bathed in a warm glow of satisfaction following a compliment about my own writing, which was nice. 

I came away from the course with quite a few pieces of work I was proud of. Having enjoyed writing again, so long after I&#8217;d left school, I decided I didn&#8217;t want to lose my scribblings in an old exercise book on a dusty shelf at home. I&#8217;d put my stories and poems on a website. 

## This website

I discovered the domain name I had hoped to use was owned by a garage owner in the Midlands. His tenure was due to expire in a few months. You can hire someone to buy an unrenewed domain on your behalf, if the owner doesn&#8217;t renew within the timeframe&#8230; usually a couple of weeks after expiry.

I was lucky, because the owner was slow to renew and he &#8216;lost&#8217; the domain name. He _was_ annoyed, sending me an email about the nerve of my action. In the end, he bought another domain name, which was a variation of his original one. He put a hyphen in between his first and second i.e. John-smith.co.uk instead of johnsmith.co.ukj to delineate it from his previous one. 

Because I wanted a website with just my name in the domain I didn&#8217;t go for a free WordPress blog. I went for &#8216;self-hosting&#8217;. Self-hosting&#8217;s a bit of a misnomer. In fact you ask another company to host your blog on their servers. But it allows you to use plugins and to design your website more in your own image. Initially I chose Hostgator.com for hosting my website and set it up using <a href="https://wordpress.com/?apppromo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WordPress</a>. After a couple of years I moved the hosting to <a href="https://www.siteground.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Siteground</a> when Hostgator got too expensive for me.

## Brighter writers

Soon after my classes ended, I joined a local writer&#8217;s group and found it fantastic to be in the company of other amateurs like me. Some of my newly discovered writers were self-publishing! I started writing some short stories with the idea of self-publishing as well, but with about 5 or 6 written, the project went on the back burner. Life keeps piling new projects into my In Tray! And I&#8217;m a butterfly, which doesn&#8217;t help.

## Scribble

While in my originaI writing group I found another in Preston called Scribble, which I attended a couple of times. But it seemed to be run on &#8216;authoritarian&#8217; lines. I wasn&#8217;t &#8216;up&#8217; for organising a literature festival. There weren&#8217;t enough of us to be able to manage it.

## Crunch time

I wanted my other group to progress on to a website and to do podcasts but privacy was a big concern and no one else was interested in going in that direction. So eventually we also parted ways, although it&#8217;s nice that one writer still keeps in touch with me.

## The work

Thankfully, the new stories and poems I&#8217;d written in the group weren&#8217;t wasted. Most remain on this website. Some are yet to be added. All grist to my mill. My only regret is that since leaving the group, my productivity slackened off&#8230; Until now!

As well as stories and poems, you&#8217;ll find the occasional video and even a few sketches on here. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time putting this together. You&#8217;ve probably got no idea how much tweaking I do day-to-day, adding (and removing) plugins that do little things for the website, updating posts, pages and images to make them as &#8216;perfect&#8217; as I can. 

Every time I look, I find something that needs improvement. So here it is. So far. 

Ta-da!
