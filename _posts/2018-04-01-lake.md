Here&#8217;s a sketch made on another grey, cold UK day.&nbsp;Having climbed over a fence, I managed to sit on a plastic bench to draw, believing less people would walk immediately behind me. I&#8217;m still very shy about drawing in public. Chiefly because I think I&#8217;m not very good. Some folk did of course peer at me, so I clutched my sketch closer. When I feel my daubs are better (hmmm can a sketch be a daub? probably not&#8230;), I might be more confident about people being around. Until then I&#8217;ll be discreet! Practice makes perfect.

My hands were frozen by the end of it but I was pleased. Trouble is I think I&#8217;m putting in too much detail. Wish I could do more sketching and less drawing but I can&#8217;t get away from the detail.

If you like water I&#8217;ve also sketched [a seaside bay](https://www.adewils.com/sketches/bay/)
