    If this sonnet is one of the worst you&#8217;ve ever read I apologise.  I think the premise is fine, but the execution is poor. When I wrote this in 2009 I was pleased with it but I now look back on it with the fondness of a father regarding his child, who is learning to walk.  This particular child never did learn to walk.  Poetry will never be my strong suit, but surely it&#8217;s the taking part that matters?

  Sonnet
</h3>

<p style="text-align: center;">
  How can it be that I can snuggle down<br /> And be cauterised, then anaesthetised,<br /> By two minute, idiotic, sales pitches<br /> And situations turning comi to tragi?<br /> All this only a matinee to the Main Event,<br /> The Pay-Per-View war on Reality TV…<br /> On the 47 inch plasma screen the sand<br /> Burns in brown and yellow, orange then red.<br /> In dayglo bibs, Essex boys douse the flames,<br /> “Hell, that Harrier’ll never jump again!”<br /> Inside, the bleached blond skeleton of the boy<br /> Whose skin, desert winds will no more caress.<br /> He’ll never push away the joystick<br /> In Afghan skies and fly home, over Iran&#8230;
