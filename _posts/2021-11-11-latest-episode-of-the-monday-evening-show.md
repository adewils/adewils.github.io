The Late Show’s dead! Well… dead to me, anyhow! The schedule on www.baytrustradio.org.uk has had an Autumn refresh, which means a change of day for me. I’m now presenting the latest episode of Bay Trust Radio’s alternative music show on Monday evening.
 
 [Here’s a podcast](https://www.mixcloud.com/BayTrustRadio/monday-evening-with-adrian-wilson-9) of the latest episode of my Monday Evening show on Bay Trust Radio. It's #109 featuring music from Led Zeppelin, Sparks, Hearing Aid Beige and Hurray For The RiffRaff!
 
 The exciting news is that from December 1st we are going to be available on kitchen radios and in cars as long as you have a DAB+ radio from the Lake District in the North, Morecambe Bay on the West coast  and North Lancs in the South of the area. We'll also continue to be available via Alexa, and on your computer and mobile devices over the internet.
 
 Join me live every week on Monday’s at 7pm (GMT)on [www.baytrustradio.org.uk](https://www.baytrustradio.org.uk)
