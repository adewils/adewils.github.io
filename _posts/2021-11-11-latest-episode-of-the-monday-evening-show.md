The Late Show’s dead! Well… dead to me, anyhow! I’m now presenting Bay Trust Radio’s alternative music show on Monday evenings.

Here’s [the latest episode](https://www.mixcloud.com/BayTrustRadio/monday-evening-with-adrian-wilson-85/) of the show from Bay Trust Radio*

It's 2023's episode #17. Along with another Start Me Up Game (in which you get the chance to guess the mystery artist and song) and a weekly Gig Guide highlighting the week’s shows in the Bay Trust Radio area, we gave you more amazing entertainment from Joan As Police Woman, Jimmy Webb, The War On Drugs and Courtney Barnett and many more alternative artists

ENJOY THE PODCAST
