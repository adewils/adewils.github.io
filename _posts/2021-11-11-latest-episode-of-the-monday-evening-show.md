The Late Show’s dead! Well… dead to me, anyhow! I’m now presenting Bay Trust Radio’s alternative music show on Monday evenings.

Here’s [the latest episode](https://www.mixcloud.com/BayTrustRadio/monday-evening-with-adrian-wilson-9/)of my Monday Evening show on Bay Trust Radio.

 It's #109 featuring music from Led Zeppelin, Sparks, Hearing Aid Beige and Hurray For The RiffRaff!

The exciting news is that from December 1st we are going to be available on kitchen radios and in cars as long as you have a DAB+ radio from the Lake District in the North, Morecambe Bay on the West coast and North Lancs in the South of the area. We'll also continue to be available via Alexa, and on your computer and mobile devices over the internet.

Join me live every week on Monday’s at 7pm (GMT)on www.baytrustradio.org.uk

_Bay Trust Radio is a registered charity (Charity Number 506296). A group of volunteers run the radio station. There’s much more information about us on our website.”
