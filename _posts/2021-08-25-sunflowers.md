I drew my impression of our sunflowers in the garden. Vincent Van Gogh is probably turning in his grave. The sunflowers are way past their best, but that’s down to some poor weather. However, it’s nice to be able to say that today’s a beautiful day! My first bit of ‘en plein air’ with pastels. My lovely mother-in-law donated the soft chalk pastels to me. Which was nice!

If you enjoyed this there’s some more sketching here ...
