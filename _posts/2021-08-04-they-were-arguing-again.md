<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">"They were arguing again"was a prompt from David Mark's <a href="https://goldster.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing class</a>. Here's where it took me.</pre>

I lifted my legs out of bed and sat up. The sound of something being smashed and things getting knocked about, came up through the ceiling. 

I pulled open my door to see Jane’s was shut. Typical. I could hear the usual loud rap music. As she didn&#8217;t answer my knock, I risked opening the door. She was doing something funny with a straw and some white powder at her desk.&nbsp;

“Don’t you ever knock?” My sister said, as truculently as ever. So sulkily in fact that she nearly knocked me out with her bottom lip.

I lied “I did, but it was drowned out by what’s going on downstairs. Don&#8217;t tell me you can&#8217;t hear them arguing!&#8221; nodding back towards the stairs. 

“No I didn’t hear that&#8230;” 

“I&#8217;m not surprised with that crappy music on.&#8221; I shouted &#8221; So how d’you know I didn’t knock?”

“You just admitted it” she smiled. A facepalm moment for me I guess.

“It’s Bon and Angus I think, can’t you hear them squealing?!”&nbsp;

“Dad’ll sort them out.” She muttered sifting the powder around with her straw.

“Jane they’re YOUR bloody Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs!! And Dad’s out.&#8221; Only my sister could name her pets after members of the Aussie rock band, AC/DC. 

&#8220;And, what’s with that powder?!” I pointed at her desk.

&nbsp;“Look! it’s sherbert!” She waved an empty Sherbert Fountain tube at me. I stuck a finger in it and licked it. She was right.

“Oh all right. Look, just sort them out, Jane.”&nbsp;

She pulled her hair back on both sides like Miss Piggy and stamped out, and down the stairs.

I lay down again in my room, pulling the covers back over my head. _Bloody hangover!_
