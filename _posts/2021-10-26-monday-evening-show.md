  The Late Show&#8217;s dead! Well&#8230; dead to me, anyhow! The schedule on <a href="http://www.baytrustradio.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.baytrustradio.org.uk</a> has had an Autumn refresh, which means a change for me.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left has-white-background-color has-background">
  After 99 episodes of the Late Show on Sunday nights, I&#8217;m now presenting the latest episode of Bay Trust Radio’s alternative music show on Monday evening.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">
  <strong>Here&#8217;s a podcast of the latest episode 107, in which I showcased the 35 artists I&#8217;d played the most over the last year (October 2020 to October 2021). If you listen to the show regularly you might be able to guess a few of them!</strong>
</p>

  <br />Join me every week, Monday&#8217;s at 7pm (GMT)!

<p class="has-text-align-left">
  Before the pandemic I recorded my radio shows in a dedicated studio at the local hospital. However when COVID-19 hit, the studio became an office. Since then Bay Trust Radio (based in Kendal, Cumbria, UK) has been waiting for the hospital to release an area to become the new studio.
</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">
  I’m still making my shows at home connecting over the internet to the main studio at Windermere General Hospital.

  You can listen 24 x 7 on your phone, tablet, your computer or on a smart speaker.
