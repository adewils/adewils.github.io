_At a writers meeting, we wrote a piece based on the &#8220;interruptions&#8221; game. Lauren gave us a starting prompt, and each of us did some free writing. Every few minutes Lauren interrupted us with another prompt, until the last, and then time was called&#8230; Eventually we read out our pieces to much fake laughter and apologies for work badly done ._

_Unfortunately my tablet chose to &#8220;die&#8221; before I could &#8216;complete&#8217;. Be that as it may here&#8217;s mine, with the &#8220;interruptions&#8221; in bold&#8230;_

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background has-magenta-background-color has-magenta-color is-style-wide" />

<hr class="wp-block-separator" />

<p class="has-drop-cap">
  <strong>It was all going reasonably well</strong>. Nobody had died at least. Then the taller of the two robots appeared to nod his head towards his compatriot and mouth to me &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t eat curry.&#8221;
</p>

&#8220;Well that&#8217;s good because we only have fish tonight. And we&#8217;re fresh out of curry sauce,&#8221; I said.

&#8220;What did he say?&#8221; squeaked St John. &#8220;Ask him to speak up.&#8221;

The taller shiny one said &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. He doesn&#8217;t get out much. I&#8217;m Norman and he&#8217;s St John, by the way.&#8221;

Norman turned his head slightly and yelled at St John, &#8220;He said&#8230; THEY DON&#8221;T HAVE ANY CURRY! MOSTLY FISH!&#8221;

  
Then to me Norman said, &#8220;I do hope that wasn&#8217;t too loud for you. I notice you have the new Apple ears and I understand they&#8217;re remarkably sensitive. Are they quite as good as people say?&#8221;

&#8220;Absolutely the bees knees. Get yourself some ASAP. I think they&#8217;re on a par&#8230;&#8221;

But before I could finish St John said &#8220;Why did he say **that was a strange place to park** a car?&#8221;

Norman started shouting again. &#8220;I DIDN&#8221;T ST JOHN. AND COULD I SAY&#8230; WOULD IT BE APPROPRIATE FOR ME TO SAY I AM GETTING TEENSY WEENY BIT IRRITATED ABOUT YOU COMING OUT TONIGHT AND NOT WEARING YOUR HEARING AIDS&#8221; he paused for breath &#8220;IDID AS YOU TO DIDN&#8221;T I? AND YOU PROMISED!&#8221;

The squeaky android, St John, departed into a burble of subsonic squelches and high pitched beeps, while making some adjustments to a dial under a flap on the right side of his breastplate. 

Then punctuated by further burbles and squeaks, he said &#8220;If you ever, EVER talk to me like that again, I will have you posted to the farthest star from Alpha Centauri reported by any supersonic space ranger charting the farthest reaches of the 900th galaxy. Now, get me another Snake-Blood or I&#8217;ll take your oh so fashionable Google glasses off your stupid face and grind them into a thin stream of silicon.&#8221; He started up a loud grinding tool from a belt waving it in a threatening manner at Norman.

This was becoming a little worrying. “You must excuse me&#8221; I said, &#8220;I’ll check with Chef. I&#8217;m sure its mainly fish tonight but we may have something with a bit more of a kick. I remember him saying we might have some horse in or he may have just been on one of his short lived hobby horses. Ha ha ha! if you&#8217;d forgive my little joke.&#8221;

Both &#8216;bots looked at me, wordlessly.

I stepped outside the small antechamber I&#8217;d taken the pair into for a few pre-prandial drinks, from where I was planning to head for the kitchen, but then I decided to stop and listen to them a little longer. Always a good idea I find, if your guests turn out to be volatile.

Low-pitched bot Norman rumbled &#8220;You know he&#8217;s beginning to bore me, just a little. Well actually quite a lot. What’s the preoccupation with matters equestrian, for a start off?&#8221;

&#8220;I know what you mean&#8221; St John squeaked. &#8220;I mean, where are the women? We came here for a night of sybaritic pleasure and no totty about. Not a sausage. I was so looking forward to putting the pedal to the metal, if you know what I mean.&#8221;

&#8220;Bunch of pooftahs you&#8217;re thinking aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;

&#8220;You have the measure of me Norman, as ever.&#8221;

&#8220;I know how your mind works, St John.&#8221;

&#8220;Listen&#8230; about before&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;No. Please. Say nothing. I completely understand. I didn&#8217;t mind the shouting. You have so much on your plate these days. If it&#8217;s not the Gariodnids on Sparta 4, it&#8217;s those damned settlers on Iscio. It&#8217;s no wonder that occasionally&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;Oh I know, it&#8217;s more than occasionally St John&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;Norman, no, please say nothing more. I can see how it is for you. I know it&#8217;s hard.&#8221;

&#8220;Hard? You don&#8217;t know the half of it&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;Here&#8230; Have you ever had some of this. No? Bot, just **take a hit on this**. It&#8217;ll blow your exproprioceptive sensors!&#8221;

I decided it was safe to leave them alone now, and check on culinary possibilities for the evening.
