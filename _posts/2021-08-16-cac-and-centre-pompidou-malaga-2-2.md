In December 2018 on a day when I was starting with “man ’flu“, I revisited CAC Màlaga for the Hernan Bas exhibition, and also ventured into Centre Pompidou Màlaga, for the first time. I&#8217;d been looking forward to that for a while.

The last time I’d been to CAC was to see Vik Muniz&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.adewils.com/latest/video-of-muniz-portraits-of-garbage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Wasteland” </a>exhibition. Before that, I&#8217;d been to a Gilbert and George show.

This was the first Spanish exhibition (called &#8220;A Brief Intermission&#8221;) for the Miami artist, Hernan Bas. It comprised 36 very contemporary paintings and drawings. Interestingly, Bas features no women in any of his paintings. He is only interested in painting males. For me this predominance of males became a little claustrophobic. However the work was very good.

“Sorting out Andy” was on view. It&#8217;s a massive painting visualising the cataloguing of Warhol’s home and artefacts after his death. The large painting was created for this exhibition.

There were other non-Bas smaller exhibitions in the main room, and the usual long standing artworks I&#8217;d seen before, on previous visits.

On the same day I walked right across town from the CAC to the port to visit the Pompidou Centre. This is an art gallery and exhibition space at Muelle Uno, Puerto de Málaga. Look for the Rubik’s Cube which is above the ground. I saw so many exhibits <a href="https://www.guidetomalaga.com/see/a-guide-to-the-pompidou-centre-in-malaga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there,</a>&nbsp;which you can see in the video.

The Pompidou Centre has a great gift shop, suitable for every pocket! I bought a couple of shopping bags featuring Van Gogh on one and Gustav Klimt on the other. Great for my wife and mother-in-law. Is that sexist?! They love shopping much more than I do.

CAC has a bookshop too. All the books are in Spanish as far as I could tell. It&#8217;s more serious than Centre Pompidou’s offering. There aren&#8217;t as many toys, keyring, rubbers etc.&nbsp;in CAC&#8217;s bookshop&#8230;<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">
