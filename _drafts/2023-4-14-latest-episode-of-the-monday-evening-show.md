Here’s [the latest episode](https://www.mixcloud.com/BayTrustRadio/monday-evening-with-adrian-wilson-83/) of Bay Trust Radio's alternative music show, the Monday Evening Show*

It's episode #15 (I started numbering shows on an annual basis from this year) featuring music from XTC, Snow Patrol, the 1975 and many more. We also had our weekly gig guide, another Start Me Up Guide and an Indie Challenge courtesy of Paul Andrew Hughes.

Listen live on our new app, on an Amazon Fire Stick vis the UKRP app, on Mixcloud.com/baytrustradio, on Alexa, and on your computer and mobile devices around the world wide web.
